## Trollskull Manor

- The group walked up and knocked on the door of the manor. They heard footsteps walk up to the door from inside, and then no one opened the door. Finally, they tried the knob and opened it, and no one was inside.
- The bottom floor of the manor was a taproom. Many of the windows were broken and all of the furniture was broken.
- There were a few barrels of what might have once been wine, but reeked of vinegar.
- The party heard what sounded like someone walking around upstairs.
- They had to leave the building and walk up a stairway from the alley to reach the second floor.
- Every room of the manor was empty and dusty. On each floor of the house, the party heard someone walking around upstairs, and never found anyone.
  - Gourdan cast Speak With Animals and started talking to his rabbit Niko, who was certain he could hear someone in the house, and was pretty freaked out.
  - Judy was getting a major tummy ache, and his breath smelled like garlic, indicating there was an evil undead presence nearby.
- When the party finally made their way to the attic, they saw what appeared to be smoke coming from a building out in the alley.
  - Called 911 immediately.
  - Ran outside to check out the fire and start evacuating people.
  - Saw some teenagers heading home, who informed them that what they saw was probably just the local forge, Steam and Steel.
  - Called 911 back to cancel the dispatch.

## Trollskull Alley

- Helena and Gnard decided to walk around and meet the neighbors.
- Met Fala, the herbalist who runs Corellon's Crown.
  - Helena was very antagonistic, told Fala to change the name of their business and remove the word "crown," or change its spelling to a "k."
  - Said her name was Gourdan.
- Met Emmek Frewn, the owner of a local pub called Frewn's Brews.
  - Helena was again very antagonistic, asked a million questions about where the beer was from, and asked if her first beer was free.
  - Emmek pulled out his phone and said he was chatting about the new inhabitants of the manor on Next Door.

## Trollskull Manor

- Gourdan, Izabella, and Judy continued to search for the elusive inhabitant within the manor, but had no luck.
