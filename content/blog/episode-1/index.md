## Meeting at the Yawning Portal

We opened in the Yawning Portal Inn and Tavern, a three-story building centered around a 40-foot wide well that plunges into a vast network of dungeons known as the Undermountain. Patrons of this inn can watch as adventuring parties descend into the Undermountain and, somewhat less frequently, ascend out of it.

Amidst the cacophany of roudy gamblers, drunken adventurers, and off-key bard, a group of four younglings sat at a table making introductions.

#### Judy Merrywood

![Judy Merrywood](./judy.png)

Judy is a 15 year-old human paladin-in-training from an upper-middle class, nuclear family where nobody tragically died. He is in the last semester of his training camp with the Order of the Gauntlet, and his final assignment to earn his Organizing Against the Forces of Evil badge and become a true recruit is to assemble an adventuring party. He posted an ad on Kraigsledger for interested prospective members and a few responders actually showed up!

#### Gourdan

Gourdan is, in every aspect except physical, a pumpkin. Physically, he's an 18 year-old firbolg who wears a hollowed-out pumpkin on his head. He wears a trench coat and long, baggy shorts, and rides around on a wooden foldable scooter. Normally, firbolgs leave the house around the age of ten, but Gourdan's been waiting to seize his destiny. Eight years past schedule, his parents finally recently sold their home to go on their cross-Faerun RV trip, so great things must be afoot for Gourdan and his senior pet rabbit, Bongo.

#### Helena Brightwave

![Helena Brightwave](./helena.png)

Helena is a palid elf studying abroad for her thesis at Harfard University (commonly misspelled with a "v"), a school on a campus located in a pocket dimension, devoid of sunlight and lit mostly by bioluminescent fungii. She is home-schooled, and her parents are both professors at Harfard; that is to say, she's lived and studied there her entire life, and is now venturing out for the first time after a mear 200 years, so she's still got that college activist spirit.

#### Gnard

![Gnard](./gnard.png)

Gnard is an twelve year-old (young adult) goblin from a settlement just outside of Waterdeep that you definitely haven't heard of, but that's not important. What is important is that the bourgeoisie is continuing to tighten its clutches around the throats of the proletariat, and as a member of the Golden Grin, a secret organization dedicated to building worker power through solidarity, it is up to Gnard to notify everyone that everything's going to be a-okay and that the capitalist elite won't stand a chance against him and the other grinners.

### Barfight

- Group of bald people with eyeballs tattooed around their scalps jumped a half-orc woman, who still managed to beat down one of them to within an inch of his life.

### "Troll!"

- A troll emerged from the well, along with a small flock of stirges.
- Gnard cast Sleep on the stirges to knock them out.
- Durnan the barkeeper grabbed a greatsword and lept over the bar to take on the troll.
- Judy threw a lantern on the troll, igniting it, as Durnan kicked it back down the well.

### Meeting with Volo

- After the fight, Volothamp Geddarm introduced himself to the party.
- He disclosed that he had not seen his friend, Floon Blagmaar, for several days and was worried about him.
- He offered the characters 10 gp each upfront to agree to track down Floon, and promised to pay 10x that when they located Floon and assured his safety.
  - Helena had the feeling Floon didn't actually have the gold to pay up for their completion of the mission, but she was a little flustered getting to meet _the_ Volothamp Geddarm and didn't say anything.
- He last saw Floon at the Skewered Dragon in the Dock Ward when they had met for drinks.
