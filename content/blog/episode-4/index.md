## Jo Hideout

- Healed up Floon just a little bit.
- Found some loot:
  - Gourdan took a spellbook off of the dead orc caster.
  - Tucked behind the stone chair in the back of the room was a small, unlocked wooden chest containing two potions of healing, 16 gp, 82 sp, and 250 cp.
- After some extensive healing, Judy was able to stand up but barely able to speak.

## The Yawning Portal

- Walked up on Volo trying to recruit another party of adventurers to try to find Floon.
- Volo was elated to see Floon was safe.
- Admitted that though he did not have the 100 gp per person, he instead gave the party the deed to Trollskull Manor, a historic building in the North Ward.
- Agreed to meet the party at the house the next day late in the morning after they'd inspected the house to take the party to have a magistrate witness the transfer of ownership.
- Judy really wanted a pie that his grandma used to make.

## Trollskull Alley

- The next morning, the party located Trollskull Manor in Trollskull Alley.
